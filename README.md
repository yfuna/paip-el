paip-el
=======

This code is a port of the Common Lisp code found in the book Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming, written by Peter Norvig. The goal of this project is to enable Emacs extension developers to use programming techniques in PAIP easily. The primary purpose of the project is not helping Emacs extention developers to understand the book but providing them with good modular software tools. If you would like to learn PAIP, I recommend you install sbcl, a Common Lisp implementation, to run and hack the code by Norvig in Common Lisp.

The original source was all written by Peter Norvig, and the copyright belongs to him.

This is a fairy new project:

- It's under development,
- It's incomplete,
- Not all the stuff, functions and macros, here works.

While it is very early in the development of the modules, all feedback is welcome via github messages and/or as github issues.
